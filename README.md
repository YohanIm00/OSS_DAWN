## üí° Motivation
![PLUM JAM](asset/README/Motivation0.png)  
DAWN was created as part of the 2024 PLUM JAM, a summer program hosted by the PLUM game development club.  
PLUM JAM is a game development hackathon where participants create games based on given keywords.  
At the time, the keywords were 'Tiramisu Cake' and 'Balloon.'  
After much deliberation on how to integrate these themes, the idea of "a cat selling tiramisu to ascend to great heights with a bundle of balloons" was born.

## üìñ Story
### Synopsis
![Synopsis](asset/README/Story0.png)  
There is Wand the black cat with an exceptional talent for making tiramisu cakes.  
One day, he gotta be captivated by the sudden appearance of the colossal cat tower, MT.CATUS.  
As Wand gazes at the tower in awe, a familiar meow echoes from the peak.  
Realizing it‚Äôs his sibling, Wand starts pondering how to overcome this situation.  
At that moment, a brilliant idea flashes through Wand‚Äôs mind:  

"Trade tiramisu cakes for balloons, and use them to float to the top!"  

The goal is 1,000 balloons! Will our Wand manage to gather enough balloons to reunite with their sibling?

### Characters
![Characters](asset/README/Story1.png)  
‚ñ≤ Character concept art: Wand on the left, Pu on the right.

- **Wand**  
  - A black domestic shorthair cat with striking amber eyes.  
  - Known as "Tiramisu Hand" for their unique ability to turn any ingredient into a tiramisu cake.  
  - Typically very quiet, often leaving others confused about what they want to say.  

- **Pu**  
  - A gray-patterned Scottish Fold cat, usually seen with their eyes closed.  
  - The head chef of Bakery Feliz, with great pride in their culinary skills.  
  - For some unknown reason, Pu seems to understand Wand‚Äôs unspoken words perfectly.  

- **(Future Characters)**  
  - Look forward to the next version for new additions!

### Environment
- **The Village**  
  - A common hillside neighborhood that looks like it could exist anywhere, but it‚Äôs uniquely inhabited only by cats.  

- **MT.CATUS**  
  ![MT.CATUS](asset/README/Story2.png)  
  - An ultra-high "cat tower" that suddenly appeared in the center of the village.  
  - The top of the tower features a prominent sign reading "MT.CATUS."  

- **Bakery Feliz**  
  ![Bakery Feliz](asset/README/Story3.png)  
  - A bakery run by Pu.  
  - Due to the nocturnal nature of most cats, the number of customers increases as time goes on.  
  - Interestingly, Pu runs the bakery based on their whims and often closes during peak hours.

## üïπÔ∏è How to Play
### Sorting Game
![SortingGame](asset/README/Sort0.png)  
- A simple sorting game that can be played using only the right and left arrow keys.  
- If you correctly process 20 consecutive orders, FEVER mode will be activated.  
  - During FEVER mode, pressing any arrow key will increase your score.  
  - FEVER mode lasts for 3 seconds.  

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/993116aa-4535-436f-b4dd-035a43bcf69d  

- If you press the wrong arrow key at any point, your score will decrease.  
  - The higher your current score, the more points you will lose, so be careful!  

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/104ba434-0cb4-4484-b46b-3eed2a7faebf  

- Aim for the highest score possible within the time limit!  
  - ~The score is supposed to carry over as the initial value in the main game.~  
  - However, it was discovered that this functionality does not work as intended.  
  - This issue will be addressed in the "Development Status" section later.  

### Main Game
![MainGame](asset/README/Bake0.png)  
- When a customer places an order, approach them and press the **S key** to take their order.  
  - If you don‚Äôt take the order on time, the customer will leave angrily.  
  - Angry cat customers will pop balloons as a consequence, so be careful!  

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d208f0a-827e-4df0-a9bc-1af138e30eb8  

- After taking an order, approach the chef Pu and, press the **S key** to start cooking.  
  - You can take up to 10 orders at a time and cook up to 4 menu items simultaneously.  
  - Cooking time depends on the menu item and is either 3 seconds or 5 seconds.  

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34d52ec0-2934-4d97-854a-602c63b5059b  

- Once the cooking is complete, you‚Äôll hear the oven‚Äôs signature completion sound, and the dish will appear on the counter.  
  - Similarly, press the **S key** at the counter to pick up the dishes in the order they were prepared.  
  - You can carry up to two dishes at a time.  

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e33bb205-342f-4510-8bfc-52ac79a69e9d  

- Take the completed dishes to the customer and press the **S key** to serve them.  
  - If the dish matches the customer‚Äôs order, they‚Äôll eat it happily and reward you with balloons.  
  - If the dish doesn‚Äôt match the order, there will be no reaction. Double-check the orders!  
  - Additionally, you **cannot take new orders while holding dishes.** Serve the dishes first, then take the next order.  

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e38536f7-1a1b-4a6c-9153-6433d3f904f5  

- If a mistake during serving leaves you with leftover food, you can press **E** or **R** to eat the food in your hands.  
  - Eating food will increase your fullness level.  

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a116463d-8da6-4d42-b49b-0d26bd47ee7d  

  - However, if your fullness level maxes out, you‚Äôll temporarily slow down, so watch out!
