## 💡 Motivation
![PLUM JAM](asset/README/Motivation0.png)  
DAWN was created as part of the 2024 PLUM JAM, a summer program hosted by the PLUM game development club.  
PLUM JAM is a game development hackathon where participants create games based on given keywords.  
At the time, the keywords were 'Tiramisu Cake' and 'Balloon.'  
After much deliberation on how to integrate these themes, the idea of "a cat selling tiramisu to ascend to great heights with a bundle of balloons" was born.
