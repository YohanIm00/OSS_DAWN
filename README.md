## üí° Motivation
![PLUM JAM](asset/README/Motivation0.png)  
DAWN was created as part of the 2024 PLUM JAM, a summer program hosted by the PLUM game development club.  
PLUM JAM is a game development hackathon where participants create games based on given keywords.  
At the time, the keywords were 'Tiramisu Cake' and 'Balloon.'  
After much deliberation on how to integrate these themes, the idea of "a cat selling tiramisu to ascend to great heights with a bundle of balloons" was born.

## üìñ Story
### Synopsis
![Synopsis](asset/README/Story0.png)  
There is Wand the black cat with an exceptional talent for making tiramisu cakes.  
One day, he gotta be captivated by the sudden appearance of the colossal cat tower, MT.CATUS.  
As Wand gazes at the tower in awe, a familiar meow echoes from the peak.  
Realizing it‚Äôs his sibling, Wand starts pondering how to overcome this situation.  
At that moment, a brilliant idea flashes through Wand‚Äôs mind:  

"Trade tiramisu cakes for balloons, and use them to float to the top!"  

The goal is 1,000 balloons! Will our Wand manage to gather enough balloons to reunite with their sibling?

### Characters

  ![MT.CATUS](asset/README/Story2.png)  
  - An ultra-high "cat tower" that suddenly appeared in the center of the village.

- **Bakery Feliz**  
  ![Bakery Feliz](asset/README/Story3.png)
